# ColorSensor: How it Works?
Creating a code for an Arduino color sensor that generates a hex code for the detected color requires both Arduino and Python programming. The [Arduino code](ArduinoColor.ino) will read the color data from the color sensor and send it to the computer through the serial port. [Python code](PythonColor.py) will receive the data from the Arduino and convert the RGB values to a hex code.
